<h1>Never give up</h1>
<pre>Never give up,
Never give in.
Move onward and upward with strength from within.

Always believe,
Always look forward.
Never be the one who is seen as a coward.

Remember the past,
Look for the future.
Always remember it's often good to be obscure.

You are special,
You are unique.
To go far in life is what you should seek.

You are brilliant,
You prove to be amazing every day,
And there is someone who will love you all the way.
