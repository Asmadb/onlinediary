<h1>King For A Day</h1>
<pre>I'm resting here quite regally
The feature of the table
Surrounded by potatoes that
I'd taste if I were able.

My subjects, scrubbed and beaming,
Circle round the royal platter
They seem to be adoring me
But something is the matter.

See me basking in the candlelight
My skin so nicely tanned
The reason for this treatment
I do not understand.

While I'd love to peck that dish of corn
And gobble down a berry
I find this jolly atmosphere
To be a trifle scary.

These human creatures were my friends
They filled me up with bread
But now I have suspicions that
They're cannibals instead!</pre>
