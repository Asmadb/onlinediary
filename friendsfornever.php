<h1>Friends For Never</h1>
<pre>Friends forever, you promised.
Never to part, you said.
But now we've fought,
Words were thrown between us...
And now I'm lying here crying on my bed.

Part of me feels,
That it'll never be the same...
Sure we've fought before,
But they were always fixed,
And we both took responsibility to the problem,
But in this one fight,
You said there was only one person to blame...
Me.

I've always been there for you.
And I know I always will,
Because I cared about you then,
And I care about you still.

Friends forever,
Was what we said we'd always be,
But look what's happened today,
We've fought and now you are gone...
So what I really need you to see,
Is what you made it feel like,
All the tears I've cried,
The hurt I've felt all through the night,
You said friends forever,
But really,
It was friends for never.</pre>
