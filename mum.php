<h1>My Mother, My Hero</h1>
<body>
<pre>My mother,
She wakes before me, sleeps after me.
She gets me ready fast and steady.

Sometimes I wonder if she is a robot.
Needs no pay, just our smiles,
Never takes rest, no matter cold or hot.
Never gets tired though she has a pile to do.
If there is a super hero, it's my mother.

I'm blessed to be blessed by her.
She scolds me and hugs me,
Makes me cry and makes me laugh.
Her touch is softer than fur.
She cares for everyone: me, my brother, and father.
If there is a super hero, it's my mother.

Mothers can die for their children,
But my mother loves me more than just that.
She is like the sweetest dove,
Sitting on a tree of love.
I am blessed that she is my mother.
If there is a super hero, it's my mother.

I know we can't always be together,
But no one can hold us apart.
She is my life,
She is my heart,
She is my mother,
She is my super hero.</pre>
