<h1>The Daily Life Of A Lazy Teenager</h1>
<pre>Hi, my name is Katy.
I'm not an active lady.
I'm happy when I'm on the couch,
But if I get up I will turn into a grouch.
I sit around and watch much TV,
And oh the joy it brings to me.
My eyes do not need a rest
For when the screen is on they work best.
I read books to ease my time.
In my head the wonders you would find.
I wrote this poem for class, you know,
And oh the writing, it goes so slow.
These will be the lines.
Now go away, it's TV time. </pre>
